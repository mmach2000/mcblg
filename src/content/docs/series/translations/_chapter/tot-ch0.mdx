  The importance of nomenclature, notation, and language as tools of thought has long been recognized. In chemistry and in botany, for example, the establishment of systems of nomenclature by Lavoisier and Linnaeus did much to stimulate and to channel later investigation. Concerning language, George Boole in his *Laws of Thought* \[1, p.24\] asserted “That language is an instrument of human reason, and not merely a medium for the expression of thought, is a truth generally admitted.”
  
  Mathematical notation provides perhaps the best-known and best-developed example of language used consciously as a tool of thought. Recognition of the important role of notation in mathematics is clear from the quotations from mathematicians given in Cajori’s *A History of Mathematical Notations* \[2, pp.332,331\]. They are well worth reading in full, but the following excerpts suggest the tone:
  
  > By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race.
  >
  > —— A.N. Whitehead
  >
  > The quantity of meaning compressed into small space by algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid.
  >
  > —— Charles Babbage

众所周知，命名体系、符号系统和语言都是承载思想的重要工具。
例如，拉瓦锡和林奈分别建立了化学领域和植物学领域的命名体系，二者都极大地激发和引导了后续的研究工作。
语言的意义同样深远：正如乔治 · 布尔在《思维规律的研究》中所言，
“语言不仅仅是表达思想的媒介，更是人类理性的工具，这一真理早已为世人所公认。”

种种语言中，数学符号无疑是最著名且最为成熟的思维工具，其在数学领域中的重要性不言而喻，
这一点在卡乔里《数学符号史》中由引述的数学家名言得以充分阐释。
这些名言值得仔细品读，以下两条摘录虽不足以囊括全貌，却已足以勾勒出其地位：

> 优良的数学符号减轻了大脑的额外负担，使其能够集中精力解决更为复杂的问题，从而有效地提升了人类的智力。

> <p text-right>—— 阿尔弗雷德 · 诺思 · 怀特海</p>
> 
> 代数符号将丰富的含义压缩于微小的空间内，因此我们习惯于借助这些符号进行推理。

  Nevertheless, mathematical notation has serious deficiencies. In particular, it lacks universality, and must be interpreted differently according to the topic, according to the author, and even according to the immediate context. Programming languages, because they were designed for the purpose of directing computers, offer important advantages as tools of thought. Not only are they universal (general-purpose), but they are also executable and unambiguous. Executability makes it possible to use computers to perform extensive experiments on ideas expressed in a programming language, and the lack of ambiguity makes possible precise thought experiments. In other respects, however, most programming languages are decidedly inferior to mathematical notation and are little used as tools of thought in ways that would be considered significant by, say, an applied mathematician.
  
  The thesis of the present paper is that the advantages of executability and universality found in programming languages can be effectively combined, in a single coherent language, with the advantages offered by mathematical notation. It is developed in four stages:
  1. Section 1 identifies salient characteristics of mathematical notation and uses simple problems to illustrate how these characteristics may be provided in an executable notation.
  2. Sections 2 and 3 continue this illustration by deeper treatment of a set of topics chosen for their general interest and utility. Section 2 concerns polynomials, and Section 3 concerns transformations between representations of functions relevant to a number of topics, including permutations and directed graphs. Although these topics might be characterized as mathematical, they are directly relevant to computer programming, and their relevance will increase as programming continues to develop into a legitimate mathematical discipline.
  3. Section 4 provides examples of identities and formal proofs. Many of these formal proofs concern identities established informally and used in preceeding sections.
  4. The concluding section provides some general comparisons with mathematical notation, references to treatments of other topics, and discussion of the problem of introducing notation in context.

尽管如此，数学符号作为思维工具仍有其不足之处。
数学符号不够统一：同一符号在不同主题、不同作者、甚至不同语境中都可能有不同的含义。
相比之下，编程语言作为指挥计算机的工具，具备了统一性、可执行性和无歧义性的显著优势。
可执行性使得我们能够借助计算机，对用编程语言表达的思想进行广泛而深入的实验；而无歧义性则使得精确的思维实验成为可能。
然而大多数编程语言在其他方面却明显不如数学符号，因此数学家很少将编程语言作为思维工具。

本文的核心论点在于，我们能够将编程语言和数学符号二者所长，融于一种统一而连贯的符号系统之中。
这种符号系统既继承了编程语言的统一性和可执行性，又兼具数学符号的种种优点。
下面分四节详细阐述这一论点：

1. 第一节将提炼数学符号系统的显著特点，并借助一系列简单的问题说明如何在一种可执行的语言中实现这些特点。

2. 第二、三节将继续使用这一符号系统探讨一些更深的主题。
第二节将探讨多项式的相关问题，而第三节将探讨函数的不同表示（包括全排列和有向图）之间的转换。
我们选择这些主题，主要是因为它们既实用，又有很多人感兴趣。
这些问题虽然属于数学范畴，却与计算机编程有着直接的联系。
随着编程科学逐渐发展为一门独立的数学学科，这种联系将变得越来越重要。

3. 第四节则展示了若干恒等式和形式证明的例子，其中许多形式证明是前几节非正式证明的形式化版本。

4. 最后一节将综合比较这种符号体系与传统数学符号系统的异同，并提供相关主题的参考资料，同时探讨在上下文中引入符号的相关问题。

  The executable language to be used is APL, a general purpose language which originated in an attempt to provide clear and precise expression in writing and teaching, and which was implemented as a programming language only after several years of use and development \[3\].
  
  Although many readers will be unfamiliar with APL, I have chosen not to provide a separate introduction to it, but rather to introduce it in context as needed. Mathematical notation is always introduced in this way rather than being taught, as programming languages commonly are, in a separate course. Notation suited as a tool of thought in any topic should permit easy introduction in the context of that topic; one advantage of introducing APL in context here is that the reader may assess the relative difficulty of such introduction.
  
  However, introduction in context is incompatible with complete discussion of all nuances of each bit of notation, and the reader must be prepared to either extend the definitions in obvious and systematic ways as required in later uses, or to consult a reference work. All of the notation used here is summarized in [Appendix A](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot1.htm#axa), and is covered fully in pages 24-60 of *APL Language* \[4\].
  
  Readers having access to some machine embodiment of APL may wish to translate the function definitions given here in *direct definition* form \[5, p.10\] (using `⍺` and `⍵` to represent the left and right arguments) to the *canonical* form required for execution. A function for performing this translation automatically is given in [Appendix B](https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot1.htm#axb).

本文所采用的“可执行语言”正是 APL。起初，这种记法并不是一门编程语言，而是一系列试图在书写和教学中引入准确而清晰的表述方式的尝试。
在多年的使用和发展后，APL 才被实现为一种编程语言。

尽管许多读者对 APL 并不熟悉，我还是决定不单独开设章节介绍 APL，而是在需要时在具体的上下文中逐步导入。
这就像数学课程中逐步介绍数学符号一样（与此相反，编程语言往往单独开设课程进行教学）。
我的观点是，好的思维工具应当能在相关的上下文中轻松介绍。
这种导入方法还有一个优点：读者可以评估 APL 各方面的相对难度。

然而，情境导入的方式并不能涵盖每种符号的全部细节。
之后若想使用本文所述的符号系统，读者需要有扩展符号定义或查阅参考资料的心理准备。
附录 A 总结了本文使用的所有符号，《APL 语言》第 24 至 60 页中也有详尽的阐述。

如果读者能接触到实现了 APL 的计算机，
可以使用附录 B 中给出的函数将本文用**直接定义形式**（direct definition form）给出的函数定义
（使用 `⍺` 和 `⍵` 来表示左右参数）转换为执行所需的**规范形式**（canonical form）[^no-need]。

[^no-need]: 译注：现如今 APL 实现（如 Dyalog APL 等）往往通过 dfn（dynamic-function）来定义含有 `⍺` 和 `⍵` 的函数，因此不再需要转换。
