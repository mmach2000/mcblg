    <section slot="content" className="*-break-normal space-y-2 md:text-justify" lang="en">
      I know exactly what you're talking about, and I'm very happy to say that it's the exception rather than the rule.
      And I'm also happy to very publicly point out that NVIDIA has been one of the worst trouble spots we've had with hardware manufacturers.
      And that is really sad because NVIDIA tries to sell chips, a lot of chips into the Android market.
      And NVIDIA has been the single worst company we've ever dealt with.

      Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that other companies are perfect either.
      We have had companies that just don't care.
      We've had companies that felt that Linux wasn't a big enough market.
      We've had situations like that.
      At the same time there's a lot of companies that have been very helpful since very early days
      and it's, I think, it's very sad when you sell hardware and you actually use Linux and you're being really difficult about it.

      I'm sad when it happens. We can't do anything about it, but it's life.
      I wish everybody was as nice as I am.
